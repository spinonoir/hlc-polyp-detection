# This directory contains the target weights to be loaded at the top level called `model.pth`
## The `other_weights` directory contains a list of other model weights along with a desceiptive name. 
When evaluating a model weight, copy it from `other_weights` as `model.pth` and update this README to reflect what the current model in the directory is.

# Current Model
Model weights after the tenth epoch of training on the first attempt with limited fine tuning.
